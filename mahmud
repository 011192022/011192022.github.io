	     <p> <h3> My hobbies & favourites </h3></p>
	  
		   My favorite hobby is to play cricket. I love this game of sports & my favorite player is shakib al hasan.<br>
		   I also love to play video games in my free time & also love to recite the poems &  my two favorite poems are
		   "Kajla Didi" & "Swadhinotar Sukh".<br> When I recite those poems, they take me to my childhood & that feelings I just 
		 can't describe in words. My favorite movie's list is very long. I love to watch psychological triller movies. Shutter Island is one of them.<br>
		 Like movie's my favorite song's list is also big. But recently I am listening the song "I'm an Albatraoz".<br>
		 My all time favorite quote is "The things which Allah is taking away from you, the better things he has kept for you for the later part of your life."</p>
